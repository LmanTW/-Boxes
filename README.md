# ğŸ“¦ Boxes
A funny programing language which is about ğŸ“¦.

> [!WARNING]
> Please don't use ğŸ“¦ to make any serious project.

## Example
Here's a an over-engineered example for printing `hi!`:
```
+anArray <- ['h', 'i', '!'] # Create a new box.
+@main <- anArray(0)+anArray(1) > Result+anArray(2) > print(Result) # Add all the letters together.
```

# Contents
* [Structure](structure)
* [Create Boxes](create-boxes)

## Structure
To do anything in ğŸ“¦, you **must** store the result into a ğŸ“¦:
```
<Actions> -> <Target>
<Target> <- <Actions> # You can also do the other way round.
```
* Target is equal to ğŸ“¦
* Action will eventually become result

You can do as many actions as you can ever possibly wish for, as long as you use `>` to split them:
```
<Target> <- 1 > Result+2 > Result+3
```

## Create Boxes
You
